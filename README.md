**THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN ITS CREATION PHASE**  
This means that this README, the [documentation](Documentation/index.md), the source code documentation and especially the source code itself
are in a transient state and not ready to be used by others.

As soon as the code _is_ ready to use with a _minimal_ feature set, and the code is documented and the documentation got some content and maybe even this README 
contains a real project description, the project will be published via nuget.org.

So if you think you might use this code or parts of it right now, please don't be suprised how much is missing or not working properly.

However, constructive comments will already be appreciated.

_ACKNOWLEDGMENT_: In its current state, about 97% of this code are borrowed from [Matt Warren](https://github.com/mattwar/iqtoolkit), and another 0.8% from [Jon Skeet](https://github.com/jskeet/DemoCode/blob/master/Abusing%20CSharp/Code/StringInterpolation/ParameterizedSql.cs).
